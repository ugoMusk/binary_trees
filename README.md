# Binary search trees

## Task-#0: [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c)

Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
* Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And value is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

### Result:
<sup><sub>RESULT is influence by the [0-main.c](./0-main.c) and [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c) test modules </sub></sup>
