### TASK-#0 New Node | : [0-binary_tree_node.c](0-binary_tree_node.c)

Write a function that creates a binary tree node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
* Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
* And value is the value to put in the new node
* When created, a node does not have any child
* Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

### RESULT:

<sup><sub>RESULT is influenced by [0-main.c](./main_tests/0-main.c) and the [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c)</sub></sup>

TASK-#1 Insert left | : [1-binary_tree_insert_left.c)(1-binary_tree_insert_left.c);

Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
* Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert theleft-child in
* And value is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
* If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

### RESULT:

<sup><sub>RESULT is influenced by [1-main.c](./main_tests/1-main.c) and the [binary_tree_print.c](./binary_tree_print.c) and a dependency from the previous task</sub></sup>

Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

* Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
* Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
* And value is the value to store in the new node
* Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
* If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
